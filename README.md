# WApp

### A simple "web view" WhatsApp desktop client

The inital thought with this was because I wanted a dock icon to boot straight
into WhatsApp (plus I wanted to have a play with Electron).

Right now it doesn't do much except just open a WhatsApp window separate from 
your browswer, so no more pinned tabs (yay).

I may extend this in future to support other stuff - theming is the first thing 
that comes to mind - but for now, it's fairly single purpose.
